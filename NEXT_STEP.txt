NEXT DIAGNOSTIC STEP - Run Test Connection Program
====================================================

The test_connect.cpp program has been created and build_test.bat has been updated.
This test will force DirectShow to actually connect to your camera and attempt to
start the graph, which will show us exactly where the connection is failing.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

1. Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" (or your VS version)
   - Search in Start Menu for "x64 Native Tools"

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd c:\apps\sacrament_graphic_cam

3. Run the build and test:
   build_test.bat

4. Keep DebugView running while the test executes to see debug output

WHAT THIS TEST WILL SHOW:
--------------------------

If successful, you'll see output like:
  - "Created Sacrament filter successfully"
  - "Added filter to graph"
  - "Found output pin, rendering..."
  - "SUCCESS: Stream rendered!"
  - "Graph running! Press Enter to stop..."

If it fails, you'll see exactly which step failed with an error code like:
  - "Failed to create Sacrament filter (0x80040154)" - Filter not registered
  - "Failed to render stream (0x80040217)" - No media types match
  - "Failed to run graph (0x########)" - Some other DirectShow error

The DebugView output will show which methods get called:
  - If you see "GetMediaType called" - good, format negotiation is happening
  - If you see "DecideBufferSize called" - good, connection is being established
  - If you see "OnThreadCreate called" - excellent, streaming thread starting
  - If you see "FillBuffer called" - SUCCESS! Frames are being requested

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
-----------------

This test will reveal the exact failure point and error code, which will tell us
whether it's:
  - A media type mismatch issue
  - A missing DirectShow interface
  - A pin connection negotiation problem
  - Something else blocking the connection

Once we see the results, we'll know exactly what to fix.
